# Servlet_ServletRequestListener_NoOfClicksCount

Events are basically occurance of something. Changing the state of an object is known as an event.
We can perform some important tasks at the occurance of these exceptions, such as counting total and current logged-in users, creating tables of the database at time of deploying the project, creating database connection object etc.

There are many Event classes and Listener interfaces in the javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages.
